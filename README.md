# Game of War
### By Conor Johnston



#### Description
##### I created the card game war that automatically plays in the console.

#### Features
- Classes
- Objects
- Conditionals
- Loops

#### Difficulties
- Often runs infinitely times, but when not, completes within 100 rounds
- It was difficult linking everything together how I wanted
- Messages don't always show up

#### Successes
- I successfully deployed all functions within classes
- It works

#### Future Work
- Fix runtime problem
- Get messages to show up
- Add webpage animation
